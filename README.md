# SIGIP-Camera-downloader
A simple camera download script for all the traffic cameras of Infraestruturas de Portugal.

The second script present should be used to help determine if a camera is down. If a camera starts sending repeated video (stoped updating) it should be checked manually and probably reported to Infraestruturas de Portugal.
